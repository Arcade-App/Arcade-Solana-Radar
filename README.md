### **About:**

Arcade is a Gaming Super-App where players can discover, play, and compete in a wide variety of casual Web3 games and On-chain tournamentsâ€”all on a single platform.  

Think of it as the "Facebook Gaming moment" for crypto, where communities can not only play but also create custom meme games within the app and host on-chain tournaments with crypto token prizes.

App is live on Solana Devnet - [(Solana Contract Address)](https://solscan.io/account/3dVx2mUwQnppaVTkmA9iHnHMHsugrvkqBJLG6pMKKwgh?cluster=devnet).

### **Inspiration:**

The Web3 gaming world is rapidly evolving but remains fragmented. Players often navigate between multiple platforms for different games, communities, and tournaments.

 In Web2, platforms like Miniclip or Poki aggregate various mini-games under one umbrella. We noticed an untapped opportunity to bring the same experience to Web3 gamers and communities.

Additionally, Web3 communities struggle to maintain engagement and retention. Arcade addresses this by providing the ability to build custom games and host on-chain tournaments, adding excitement and enhancing user involvement.
